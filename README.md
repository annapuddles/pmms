# What is pmms?

pmms (Poodle's Multimedia System) is a tool to watch videos in sync with others across multiple different platforms.

# How do I use it?

There is a public instance of pmms hosted at https://annapuddles.com/pmms. Select a video from the catalog or enter your own custom video URL to create a room, then share the URL with others!

You may also use the files in this repository to host your own private instance.

## What's required for a private instance?

You'll need your own server with Apache, PHP and MySQL installed. The provided [pmms.sql](pmms.sql) script can be used to create the necessary tables in the database.
